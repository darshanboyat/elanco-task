            Elanco has built many of its services from scratch following
            industry best practices and leveraging software-defined solutions
            wherever possible. One service is Elancoâ€™s Cloud Environment, which
            can be interacted with to produce a rich data extract to help us
            understand areas of improvement within our business. Elanco has
            provided you with access to some of their anonymised Cloud Computing
            data. It includes information about the various applications and the
            accompanying compute resources that run Elanco day-to-day. Using the
            provided data, Elanco would like you to build an application to
            fulfil a certain set of requirements.
